# Persona-news-website
This is a personal project in which I am learning to use the APIs and incidentally developing my knowledge in Angular, currently I would like to make a news site, but it is a project that involves a lot of work which I am willing to apply and therefore I need to update a lot requests, currently the system does not allow me more than 50 updates and I need more to achieve development, I will improve the interface and while I am updating I will leave the update numbers with their respective numbers.

<h3>Thanks NewsCatcher News for supply me the api.</h3>
